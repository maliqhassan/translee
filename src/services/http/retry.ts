/**
 * A conservative retry policy.
 *
 * Only failures that a second attempt could plausibly fix are retried: a
 * dropped connection, a timeout, and 5xx responses. Everything else — a
 * malformed request, an unsupported pair, a rejected credential, a malformed
 * response — will fail identically every time, so retrying only makes the user
 * wait longer for the same answer.
 *
 * `rate_limited` is deliberately NOT retried. Retrying into a rate limit is how
 * a soft limit becomes a hard ban; honouring it needs the server's backoff
 * hint, which is a deliberate design job rather than a default.
