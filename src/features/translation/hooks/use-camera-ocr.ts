/**
 * Scanning text with the camera, as the translate screen needs it.
 *
 * Owns the flow, the state a control renders from, and the entitlement
 * decision; the screen never sees the camera, the recogniser or the plan.
 * Opening the scanner is the only thing that can ask for the camera
 * permission, and it happens on a tap and nowhere else.
 *
 * Three things have to be true before a scan can start, and they are checked
 * in this order: the capability has shipped, the device can do it, and the
 * plan includes it. The order decides what the user is told — a phone with no
 * recogniser reads as unavailable and is never offered an upgrade, because
 * upgrading would not give it one.
 *
 * Recognised text is handed to the caller and nothing else — not logged, and
 * not translated automatically. The user reads it, fixes anything the
 * recogniser misread, and presses Translate themselves, exactly as with typed
 * or dictated text.
